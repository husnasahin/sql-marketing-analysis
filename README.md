# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis (SQL Project)

## Description
This project analyzes the performance of marketing campaigns using SQL. The goal was to evaluate key metrics such as CPM (Cost Per Mille), CTR (Click-Through Rate), and ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment) across various campaigns, by using date and window functions to compare performance month-over-month.

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- **CPM** (Cost Per Mille)
- **CTR** (Click-Through Rate)
- **ROMI** (Return on Marketing Investment)

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Date and window functions for data manipulation and analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.sql` file with any SQL editor (e.g., DBeaver).
3. Run the queries to analyze the marketing campaign data.

## Project Goals
- Calculate month-over-month percentage changes in CPM, CTR, and ROMI for each campaign.
- Provide insights into the performance of marketing campaigns over time.

## Conclusion
The project helps to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and supports decision-making with actionable insights derived from SQL-based analysis.
